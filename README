This is a very basic Buildout to aid myself to migrate data from Plone 3 
to Plone 4.

Directly upgrading to Plone 4 is easier than this.

To build a plone 3 site:

$ python2.4 bootstrap-plone3.py
$ bin/buildout -c buildout-plone3.cfg

To build a plone 4 site:

$ python2.4 bootstrap-plone4.py
$ bin/buildout -c buildout-plone4.cfg
